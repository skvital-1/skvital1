<h1>My experience so far...</h1>
<p> My experience with freeCodeCamp has been exciting even tho it was not easy during the hosting session. 
<h3>How I felt towards the program</h3>
When i started it was very easy for me because i was practicing html and css before i came to school. At first i was not feeling the Computer Science program because we were not practicing coding as i imagined. 
Over the weeks, my knowledge on html and css has expanded due to the introduction of free code camp. I have been able to apply most of the principles taught by our lecturer. 
<h3>Hosting Struggles</h3>
During the hosting session, it was quite complex. I found difficulties but later conquered
